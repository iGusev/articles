# Implementing a Range Operator into PHP

## Introduction

This article will demonstrate how to implement a new operator in PHP. The
following steps will be taken to do this:
 - **Updating the lexer**: This will make it aware of the new operator syntax
 so that it can be turned into a token
 - **Updating the parser**: This will say where it can be used, as well as what
 precedence and associativity it will have
 - **Updating the compilation stage**: This is where the abstract syntax tree
 (AST) is traversed and opcodes are emitted from it
 - **Updating the Zend VM**: This is used to handle the interpretation of the
 new opcode for the operator during script execution

This article therefore seeks to provide a brief overview of a number of PHP's
internal aspects.

Also, a big thank you to [Nikita Popov](https://github.com/nikic/) for
proofreading and helping to improve my article!

## The Range Operator

The operator that will be added into PHP in this article will be called the
range operator (`|>`). To keep things simple, the range operator will be
defined with the following semantics:
 1. The incrementation step will always be one
 2. Both operands must either be integers or floats
 3. If min = max, return a one element array consisting of min.

(The above points will all be referenced in the final section, **Updating the
Zend VM**, when we finally implement the above semantics.)

If any of the above semantics are not satisfied, then an `Error` exception
will be thrown. This will therefore occur if:
 - either operand is not an integer or float
 - min > max
 - the range (max - min) is too large

Examples:
 ```PHP
1 |> 3; // [1, 2, 3]
2.5 |> 5; // [2.5, 3.5, 4.5]

$a = $b = 1;
$a |> $b; // [1]

2 |> 1; // Error exception
1 |> '1'; // Error exception
new StdClass |> 1; // Error exception
 ```

## Updating the Lexer

Firstly, the new token must be registered in the lexer so that when the source
code is tokenised, it will turn `|>` into the `T_RANGE` token. For this, the
[Zend/zend_language_scanner.l](http://lxr.php.net/xref/PHP_7_0/Zend/zend_language_scanner.l)
file will need to be updated by adding the following code to it (where all of
the other tokens are defined, line ~1200):
```C
<ST_IN_SCRIPTING>"|>" {
	RETURN_TOKEN(T_RANGE);
}
```

The `ST_IN_SCRIPTING` mode is the state the lexer is currently in. This means
it will only match the `|>` character sequence when it is in normal scripting
mode. The code between the curly braces is C code that will be executed when
`|>` is found in the source code. In this example, it simply returns a
`T_RANGE` token.

Digression:
> Since we're modifying the lexer, we will need Re2c to regenerate it. This
dependency is not needed for normal builds of PHP.

Next, the `T_RANGE` identifier must be declared in the
[Zend/zend_language_parser.y](http://lxr.php.net/xref/PHP_7_0/Zend/zend_language_parser.y)
file. To do this, we must add the following line to where the other token
identifiers are declared (at the end will do, line ~220):
```
%token T_RANGE 		     "|> (T_RANGE)"
```

PHP now recognises the new operator:
```PHP
1 |> 2; // Parse error: syntax error, unexpected '|>' (T_RANGE) in...
```

But since its usage hasn't been defined yet, using it will lead to a parse
error. This will be fixed in the next section.

First though, we must regenerate the **ext/tokenizer/tokenizer_data.c** file in
the tokenizer extension to cater for the newly added token. (The tokenizer
extension simply provides an interface for PHP's lexer to userland through the
`token_get_all` and `token_name` functions.) At the moment, it is blissfully
ignorant of our new `T_RANGE` token:
```PHP
echo token_name(token_get_all('<?php 1|>2;')[2][0]); // UNKNOWN
```

We regenerate the **ext/tokenizer/tokenizer_data.c** file by going into the
**ext/tokenizer** directory and executing the **tokenizer_data_gen.sh** file.
Then go back into the root php-src directory and build PHP again. Now the
tokenizer extension works again:
```PHP
echo token_name(token_get_all('<?php 1|>2;')[2][0]); // T_RANGE
```


## Updating the Parser

The parser needs to be updated now so that it can validate where the new
`T_RANGE` token is used in PHP scripts. It's also responsible for stating the
precedence and associativity of the new operator and generating the abstract
syntax tree (AST) node for the new construct. This will all be done in the
[Zend/zend_language_parser.y](http://lxr.php.net/xref/PHP_7_0/Zend/zend_language_parser.y)
grammar file, which contains the token definitions and production rules that
Bison will use to generate the parser from.

Digression:
> **Precedence** determines the rules of grouping expressions. For example, in
the expression `3 + 4 * 2`, `*` has a higher precedence than `+`, and so it
will be grouped as `3 + (4 * 2)`.
> 
> **Associativity** is how the operator will behave when chained. It determines
whether the operator can be chained, and if so, then what direction it will be
grouped from in a particular expression. For example, the ternary operator has
(rather strangely) left-associativity, and so it will be grouped and executed
from left to right. Therefore, the following expression:
```PHP
1 ? 0 : 1 ? 0 : 1; // 1
```
Will be executed as follows:
```PHP
(1 ? 0 : 1) ? 0 : 1; // 1
```
This can, of course, be changed (read: rectified) to be right-associative with
proper grouping:
```PHP
$a = 1 ? 0 : (1 ? 0 : 1); // 0
```
Some operators, however, are non-associative and therefore cannot be chained at
all. For example, the less than (`>`) operator is like this, and so the
following is invalid:
```PHP
1 < $a < 2;
```

Since the range operator will evaluate to an array, having it as an input
operand to itself would be rather useless (i.e. `1 |> 3 |> 5` would
be non-sensical). So let's make the operator non-associative, and whilst we're
at it, let's set it to have the same precedence as the combined comparison
operator (`T_SPACESHIP`). This is done by adding the `T_RANGE` token onto the
end of the following line (line ~70):
```
%nonassoc T_IS_EQUAL T_IS_NOT_EQUAL T_IS_IDENTICAL T_IS_NOT_IDENTICAL T_SPACESHIP T_RANGE
```

Next, we must update the `expr_without_variable` production rule to cater for
our new operator. This will be done by adding the following code into the rule
(I placed it just below the `T_SPACESHIP` rule, line ~930):
```
	|	expr T_RANGE expr
			{ $$ = zend_ast_create(ZEND_AST_RANGE, $1, $3); }
```

The pipe character (|) is used to denote an *or*, meaning that any one of
those rules can match in that particular production rule. The code within
the curly braces is to be executed when that match occurs. The `$$` denotes
the result node that stores the value of the expression. The `zend_ast_create`
function is used to create our AST node for our operator. This AST node is
created with the name `ZEND_AST_RANGE`, and has two values: `$1` references the
left operand (**expr** T_RANGE expr) and `$3` references the right operand
(expr T_RANGE **expr**).

Next, we will need to define the `ZEND_AST_RANGE` constant for the AST. To do
this, the [Zend/zend_ast.h](http://lxr.php.net/xref/PHP_7_0/Zend/zend_ast.h)
file will need to be updated by simply adding the `ZEND_AST_RANGE` constant
under the list of two children nodes (I added it under `ZEND_AST_COALESCE`):
```
	ZEND_AST_RANGE,
```

Now executing our range operator will just cause the interpreter to hang:
```PHP
1 |> 2;
```

It's time to update the compilation stage.


## Updating the Compilation Stage

We now need to update the compilation stage. The parser outputs an AST that
is then recursively traversed, where functions are triggered to execute as each
node in the AST is visited. These triggered functions emit opcodes that the
Zend VM will then execute later during the interpretation phase.

This compilation happens in [Zend/zend_compile.c](http://lxr.php.net/xref/PHP_7_0/Zend/zend_compile.c),
so let's start by adding our new AST node name (`ZEND_AST_RANGE`) into the
large switch statement in the `zend_compile_expr` function (I've added it just
below `ZEND_AST_COALESCE`, line ~7200):
```C
		case ZEND_AST_RANGE:
			zend_compile_range(result, ast);
			return;
```

Now we must define the `zend_compile_range` function somewhere in that same
file:
```C
void zend_compile_range(znode *result, zend_ast *ast) /* {{{ */
{
	zend_ast *left_ast = ast->child[0];
	zend_ast *right_ast = ast->child[1];
	znode left_node, right_node;

	zend_compile_expr(&left_node, left_ast);
	zend_compile_expr(&right_node, right_ast);

	zend_emit_op_tmp(result, ZEND_RANGE, &left_node, &right_node);
}
/* }}} */
```

We start by firstly dereferencing the left and right operands of the
`ZEND_AST_RANGE` node into the pointer variables `left_ast` and `right_ast`. We
then define two `znode` variables that will hold the result of compiling down
the AST nodes for both of the operands (this is the recursive part of
traversing the AST and compiling its nodes into opcodes).

Next, we emit the `ZEND_RANGE` opcode with its two operands using the
`zend_emit_op_tmp` function.

Now would probably be a good time to quickly discuss opcodes and their types
to better explain the usage of the `zend_emit_op_tmp` function.

Opcodes are instructions that are executed by the Zend VM. They each have:
 - a name (a constant that maps to some integer)
 - an op1 node (optional)
 - an op2 node (optional)
 - a result node (optional). This is usually used to store a temporary value of
 the opcode operation
 - an extended value (optional). This is an integer value that is used to
 differentiate between behaviours for overloaded opcodes

Digression:
> The opcodes for a PHP script can be seen using either:
> - PHPDBG: `sapi/phpdbg/phpdbg -np* program.php`
> - Opcache
> - [Vulcan Logic Disassembler (VLD) extension]
(https://pecl.php.net/package/vld): `sapi/cli/php -dvld.active=1 program.php`
> - Or, if the script is short and trivial, then [3v4l](https://3v4l.org) can
be used

Opcode nodes (`znode_op` structures) can be of a number of different types:
 - `IS_CV` - for **C**ompiled **V**ariables. These are simple variables (like
 `$a`) that are cached in a simple array to bypass hash table lookups. They
 were introduced in PHP 5.1 under the Compiled Variables optimisation. They're
 denoted by `!n` in VLD (where **n** is an integer)
 - `IS_VAR` - for all other variable-like expressions that aren't simple (like
 `$a->b`). They can hold an `IS_REFERENCE` zval, and are denoted by `$n` in VLD
 (where **n** is an integer)
 - `IS_CONST` - for literal values (e.g. hard-coded strings)
 - `IS_TMP_VAR` - temporary variables are used to hold the intermediate result
 of an expression (making them typically short-lived). They too can be
 refcounted (as of PHP 7), but cannot hold an `IS_REFERENCE` zval (because
 temporary values cannot be used as references). They are denoted by `~n` in
 VLD (where **n** is an integer)
 - `IS_UNUSED` - generally used to mark an op node as not used. Sometimes,
 however, data will be stored in the `znode_op.num` member to be used in the
 VM.

This brings us back to the above `zend_emit_op_tmp` function, which will emit a
`zend_op` with a type of `IS_TMP_VAR`. We want to do this because our operator
will be an expression, and so the value it produces (an array) will be a
temporary variable that may be used as an operand to another opcode (such as
`ASSIGN` from code like `$var = 1 |> 3;`).


## Updating the Zend VM

Now we will need to update the Zend VM to handle the execution of our new
opcode. This will involve updating the **Zend/zend_vm_def.h** file by adding
the following code (at the bottom will do):
```C
ZEND_VM_HANDLER(182, ZEND_RANGE, CONST|TMP|VAR|CV, CONST|TMP|VAR|CV)
{
	USE_OPLINE
	zend_free_op free_op1, free_op2;
	zval *op1, *op2, *result, tmp;

	SAVE_OPLINE();
	op1 = GET_OP1_ZVAL_PTR_DEREF(BP_VAR_R);
	op2 = GET_OP2_ZVAL_PTR_DEREF(BP_VAR_R);
	result = EX_VAR(opline->result.var);

	// if both operands are integers
	if (Z_TYPE_P(op1) == IS_LONG && Z_TYPE_P(op2) == IS_LONG) {
		// for when min and max are integers
	} else if ( // if both operands are either integers or doubles
		(Z_TYPE_P(op1) == IS_LONG || Z_TYPE_P(op1) == IS_DOUBLE)
		&& (Z_TYPE_P(op2) == IS_LONG || Z_TYPE_P(op2) == IS_DOUBLE)
	) {
		// for when min and max are either integers or floats
	} else {
		// for when min and max are neither integers nor floats
	}

	FREE_OP1();
	FREE_OP2();
	ZEND_VM_NEXT_OPCODE_CHECK_EXCEPTION();
}
```
(The opcode number should be one more than the previous highest, so 182 may
already be taken for you. To quickly see what the highest current opcode number
is, look at the bottom of the **Zend/zend_vm_opcodes.h** file - the
`ZEND_VM_LAST_OPCODE` constant should hold this value.)

Digression:
> The above code contains a number of pseudo-macros (like `USE_OPLINE` and
`GET_OP1_ZVAL_PTR_DEREF`). These aren't actual C macros - instead, they're
replaced by the **Zend/zend_vm_gen.php** script during VM generation, as
opposed to by the preprocessor during source code compilation. Therefore, if
you'd like to look up their definitions, you'll need to dig through the
**Zend/zend_vm_gen.php** file.

The `ZEND_VM_HANDLER` pseudo-macro contains each opcode's definition. It can
have 5 parameters:
 1. The opcode number (182)
 2. The opcode name (ZEND_RANGE)
 3. The valid left operand types (CONST|TMP|VAR|CV) (see `$vm_op_decode` in
**Zend/zend_vm_gen.php** for all types)
 4. The valid right operand types (CONST|TMP|VAR|CV) (ditto)
 5. An optional flag holding the extended value for overloaded opcodes (see
`$vm_ext_decode` in **Zend/zend_vm_gen.php** for all types)

From our above definitions of the types, we can see that:
```PHP
// CONST enables for
1 |> 5.0;

// TMP enables for
(2**2) |> (1 + 3);

// VAR enables for
$cmplx->var |> $var[1];

// CV enables for
$a |> $b;
```

Digression:
> If one or both operands are not used, then they are marked with `ANY`.

Digression:
> `TMPVAR` was introduced into ZE3 and is similar to `TMP|VAR` in that it
handles the same opcode node types, but differs in what code is genereted.
`TMPVAR` generates a single method to handle both `TMP` and `VAR`, which
decreases the VM size but requires more conditional logic. Conversely,
`TMP|VAR` generates methods for both of `TMP` and `VAR`, increasing the VM size
but with less conditionals.

Moving onto the body of our opcode definition, we begin by invoking the
`USE_OPLINE` pseudo-macro to declare the `opline` variable (a `zend_op`
struct). This will be used to fetch the operands (with pseudo-macros like
`GET_OP1_ZVAL_PTR_DEREF`) and setting the return value of the opcode.

Next, we declare two `zend_free_op` variables. These are simply [pointers to
zvals](http://lxr.php.net/xref/PHP_7_0/Zend/zend_execute.h#314) that are
declared for each operand we use. They are used when checking if that
particular operand needs to be freed. Four `zval` variables are then declared.
`op1` and `op2` are pointers to `zval`s that hold the operand values. `result`
is declared to store the result of the opcode operation. Lastly, `tmp` is
used as an intermediary value of the range looping operation that will be
copied upon each iteration into a hash table.

The `op1` and `op2` variables are then initialised by the
`GET_OP1_ZVAL_PTR_DEREF` and `GET_OP2_ZVAL_PTR_DEREF` pseudo-macros,
respectively. These pseudo-macros are also responsible for [initialising the
`free_op1` and `free_op2` variables]
(http://lxr.php.net/xref/PHP_7_0/Zend/zend_vm_gen.php#142). The `BP_VAR_R`
constant that is passed into the aforementioned macros is a type flag. It
stands for *BackPatching Variable Read* and is used when [fetching compiled
variables](http://lxr.php.net/xref/PHP_7_0/Zend/zend_execute.c#_get_zval_cv_lookup).
Lastly, the opline's result is dereferenced and assigned to `result`, to be
used later on.

Let's now fill in the first `if` body when both `min` and `max` are integers:
```C
zend_long min = Z_LVAL_P(op1), max = Z_LVAL_P(op2);
zend_ulong size, i;

if (min > max) {
	zend_throw_error(NULL, "Min should be less than (or equal to) max");
	HANDLE_EXCEPTION();
}

// calculate size (one less than the total size for an inclusive range)
size = max - min;

// the size cannot be greater than or equal to HT_MAX_SIZE
// HT_MAX_SIZE - 1 takes into account the inclusive range size
if (size >= HT_MAX_SIZE - 1) {
	zend_throw_error(NULL, "Range size is too large");
	HANDLE_EXCEPTION();
}

// increment the size to take into account the inclusive range
++size;

// set the zval type to be a long
Z_TYPE_INFO(tmp) = IS_LONG;

// initialise the array to a given size
array_init_size(result, size);
zend_hash_real_init(Z_ARRVAL_P(result), 1);
ZEND_HASH_FILL_PACKED(Z_ARRVAL_P(result)) {
	for (i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
		Z_LVAL(tmp) = min + i;
		ZEND_HASH_FILL_ADD(&tmp);
	}
} ZEND_HASH_FILL_END();
ZEND_VM_NEXT_OPCODE_CHECK_EXCEPTION();
```

We start by defining the `min` and `max` variables. These are declared as
`zend_long`, which must be used when declaring long integers (likewise with
`zend_ulong` for defining unsigned long integers). This size is then declared
as `zend_ulong`, which will hold the size of the array to be generated.

A check is then performed to see if `min` is greater than `max` - if it is, an
`Error` exception is thrown. By passing in `NULL` as the first argument to
`zend_throw_error`, the exception class defaults to `Error`. We could
specialise this exception by sub-classing Error and make a new class entry in
[Zend/zend_exceptions.c](http://lxr.php.net/xref/PHP_7_0/Zend/zend_exceptions.c),
but that's probably best covered in a later article. If an exception is thrown,
then we invoke the `HANDLE_EXCEPTION` pseudo-macro that skips onto the next
opcode to be executed.

Next, we calculate the size of the array to be generated. This size is one less
than the actual size because it does not take into account the inclusive range.
The reason why we don't simply plus one onto this size is because of the
potential for overflow to occur if `min` is equal to `ZEND_LONG_MIN`
(`PHP_INT_MIN`) and `max` is equal to `ZEND_LONG_MAX` (`PHP_INT_MAX`).

The size is then checked against the `HT_MAX_SIZE` constant to ensure that the
array will fit inside of the hash table. The total array size must not be
greater than or equal to `HT_MAX_SIZE` - if it is, then we once again throw an
Error exception and exit the VM.

Because `HT_MAX_SIZE` is equal to `INT_MAX + 1`, we know that if `size` is less
than this, we can safely increment size without fear of overflow. So this is
what we do next so that our `size` now accommodates for an inclusive range.

We then change the type of the `tmp` zval to `IS_LONG`, and then initialise
`result` using the `array_init_size` macro. This macro basically sets the type
of `result` to `IS_ARRAY_EX`, allocates memory for the `zend_array` structure
(a hashtable), and sets up its corresponding hashtable. The
`zend_hash_real_init` function then allocates memory for the `Bucket`
structures that hold each of the elements of the array. The second argument,
`1`, specifies that we would like it to be a packed hashtable.

Digression:
> A packed hashtable is effectively an *actual* array, i.e. one that is
numerically accessed via integer keys (unlike typical associative arrays in
PHP). This optimisation was introduced into PHP 7 because it was recognised
that many arrays in PHP were integer indexed (keys in increasing order). Packed
hashtables allow the hashtable buckets to be directly accessed (like a normal
array). See Nikita's [PHP's new hashtable implementation]
(http://nikic.github.io/2014/12/22/PHPs-new-hashtable-implementation.html)
article for more information.

Digression:
> The `_zend_array` structure has two aliases: `zend_array` and `HashTable`.

Next, we populate the array. This is done with the `ZEND_HASH_FILL_PACKED`
macro ([definition](http://lxr.php.net/xref/PHP_7_0/Zend/zend_hash.h#873)),
which basically keeps track of the current bucket to insert into. The `tmp`
zval stores the intermediary result (the array element) when generating the
array. The `ZEND_HASH_FILL_ADD` macro makes a copy of `tmp`, inserts this copy
into the current hashtable bucket, and increments to the next bucket for the
next iteration.

Finally, the `ZEND_VM_NEXT_OPCODE_CHECK_EXCEPTION` macro (introduced in ZE3
to replace the separate `CHECK_EXCEPTION()` and `ZEND_VM_NEXT_OPCODE()`
calls made in ZE2) checks whether an exception has occurred. Provided an
exception hasn't occurred, then the VM skips onto the next opcode.

Let's now take a look at the `else if` block:
```C
long double min, max, size, i;

if (Z_TYPE_P(op1) == IS_LONG) {
	min = (long double) Z_LVAL_P(op1);
	max = (long double) Z_DVAL_P(op2);
} else if (Z_TYPE_P(op2) == IS_LONG) {
	min = (long double) Z_DVAL_P(op1);
	max = (long double) Z_LVAL_P(op2);
} else {
	min = (long double) Z_DVAL_P(op1);
	max = (long double) Z_DVAL_P(op2);
}

if (min > max) {
	zend_throw_error(NULL, "Min should be less than (or equal to) max");
	HANDLE_EXCEPTION();
}

size = max - min;

if (size >= HT_MAX_SIZE - 1) {
	zend_throw_error(NULL, "Range size is too large");
	HANDLE_EXCEPTION();
}

// we cast the size to an integer to get rid of the decimal places,
// since we only care about whole number sizes
size = (int) size + 1;

Z_TYPE_INFO(tmp) = IS_DOUBLE;

array_init_size(result, size);
zend_hash_real_init(Z_ARRVAL_P(result), 1);
ZEND_HASH_FILL_PACKED(Z_ARRVAL_P(result)) {
	for (i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
		Z_DVAL(tmp) = min + i;
		ZEND_HASH_FILL_ADD(&tmp);
	}
} ZEND_HASH_FILL_END();
ZEND_VM_NEXT_OPCODE_CHECK_EXCEPTION();
```

Digression:
> We use `long double` to handle the cases where there is potentially a mix of
floats and integers as operands. This is because `double` only has 53 bits of
precision, and so any integer greater than 2^53 may not be accurately
represented as a `double`. `long double`, on the other hand, has at least 64
bits of precision, and so it can therefore accurately represent 64 bit
integers.

This code is very similiar to the previous logic. The main difference now is
that we handle the data as floating point numbers. This includes fetching them
with the `Z_DVAL_P` macro, setting the type info for `tmp` to `IS_DOUBLE`,
and inserting the zval (of type double) with the `Z_DVAL` macro.

Lastly, we must handle the case where either (or both) `min` and `max` are not
integers or floats. As defined in point #2 of our range operator semantics,
only integers and floats are supported as operands - if anything else is
provided, an Error exception will be thrown. Paste the following code in the
`else` block:
```C
zend_throw_error(NULL, "Unsupported operand types - only ints and floats are supported");
HANDLE_EXCEPTION();
```

With our opcode definition done, we must now regenerate the VM. This is done by
running the **Zend/zend_vm_gen.php** file, which will use the
**Zend/zend_vm_def.h** file to regenerate the **Zend/zend_vm_opcodes.h**,
**Zend/zend_vm_opcodes.c**, and **Zend/zend_vm_execute.h** files.

Now build PHP again so that we can see the range operator in action:
```PHP
var_dump(1 |> 1.5);

var_dump(PHP_INT_MIN |> PHP_INT_MIN + 1);
```

Outputs:
```
array(1) {
  [0]=>
  float(1)
}

array(2) {
  [0]=>
  int(-9223372036854775808)
  [1]=>
  int(-9223372036854775807)
}
```

Now our operator finally works! We're not quite done yet, though. We still need
to update the AST pretty printer (that turns the AST back to code). It
currently does not support our range operator - this can be seen by using it
within `assert()`:
```PHP
assert(1 |> 2); // segfaults
```

Digression:
> `assert()` uses the pretty printer to output the expression being asserted as
part of its error message upon failure. This is only done when the asserted
expression is not in string form (since the pretty printer would not be needed
otherwise), and is something that is new to PHP 7.

To rectify this, we simply need to update the [Zend/zend_ast.c]
(http://lxr.php.net/xref/PHP_7_0/Zend/zend_ast.c) file to turn our
`ZEND_AST_RANGE` node into a string. We will firstly update the precedence
table comment (line ~520) by specifying our new operator to have a priority of
170 (this should match the zend_language_parser.y file):
```
*  170     non-associative == != === !== |>
```

Next, we need to insert a `case` statement in the `zend_ast_export_ex` function
to handle `ZEND_AST_RANGE` (just above `case ZEND_AST_GREATER`):
```C
case ZEND_AST_RANGE:                   BINARY_OP(" |> ",  170, 171, 171);
case ZEND_AST_GREATER:                 BINARY_OP(" > ",   180, 181, 181);
case ZEND_AST_GREATER_EQUAL:           BINARY_OP(" >= ",  180, 181, 181);
```

The pretty printer has been updated now and `assert()` works fine once again:
```PHP
assert(false && 1 |> 2); // Warning: assert(): assert(false && 1 |> 2) failed...
```


## Conclusion

This article has covered a lot of ground, albeit thinly. It has shown the
stages ZE goes through when running PHP scripts, how these stages
interoperate with one-another, and how we can modify each of these stages to
include a new operator into PHP. This article demonstrated just one possible
implementation of the range operator in PHP - I hope to cover an alternative
(and better) implementation, as well as other related topics in a future
articles (like creating new internal classes).
