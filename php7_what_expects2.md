>What to Expect When You're Expecting: PHP 7, Part 2
https://blog.engineyard.com/2015/what-to-expect-php-7-2


As you probably already know, PHP 7 is a thing, and itâ€™s coming this year! Which makes this as good a time as any to go over whatâ€™s new and improved.

In the [first part of this series](/2015/what-to-expect-php-7), we looked at the some of the most important inconsistency fixes coming up in PHP 7 as well as two of the biggest new features. In this post, we take a look another six big features to land in PHP 7 that youâ€™ll want to know about.

## Unicode Codepoint Escape Syntax


The syntax used is `\u{CODEPOINT}`, for example the green heart, ðŸ’š, can be expressed as the PHP string: "\u{1F49A}".
The addition of a new escape character, `\u`, allows us to specify Unicode character code points (in hexidecimal) unambiguously inside PHP strings:

<a name="read-more" class="read-more-anchor"></a>

## Null Coalesce Operator

Another new operator, the [Null Coalesce Operator](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/isset_ternary),Â `??`, is effectively the fabled ifsetor. It will return the left operand if it is not `NULL`, otherwise it will return the right.

The important thing is that it will not raise a notice if the left operand is a non-existent variable. This is like `isset()` and unlike the `?:` short ternary operator.

You can also chain the operators to return the first non-null of a given set:

```php
$config = $config ?? $this->config ?? static::$defaultConfig;
```

## Bind Closure on Call

With PHP 5.4 we saw the addition of `Closure->bindTo()` and `Closure::bind()` which allows you change the binding of `$this` and the calling scope, together, or separately, creating a duplicate closure.

PHP 7 now adds an easy way to do this at call time, binding both `$this` and the calling scope to the same object with the addition of `Closure->call()`. This method takes the object as itâ€™s first argument, followed by any arguments to pass into the closure, like so:

```php
class HelloWorld {
     private $greeting = "Hello";
}

$closure = function($whom) { echo $this->greeting . ' ' . $whom; }

$obj = new HelloWorld();
$closure->call($obj, 'World'); // Hello World
```

## Group Use Declarations

If youâ€™ve ever had to import many classes from the same namespace, youâ€™ve probably been very happy if your IDE will auto-complete them for you. For others, and for brevity, PHP 7 now has [Group Use Declarations](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/group_use_declarations). This allows you to quickly specify many similar imports with better clarity:

```php
// Original
use Framework\Component\SubComponent\ClassA;
use Framework\Component\SubComponent\ClassB as ClassC;
use Framework\Component\OtherComponent\ClassD;
```


```php
// With Group Use
use Framework\Component\{
     SubComponent\ClassA,
     SubComponent\ClassB as ClassC,
     OtherComponent\ClassD
};
```

It can also be used with constant and function imports with use function, and use const, as well as supporting mixed imports:

```php
use Framework\Component\{
     SubComponent\ClassA,
     function OtherComponent\someFunction,
     const OtherComponent\SOME_CONSTANT
};
```

## Generators Improvements

### Generator Return Expressions

There are two new features added to generators. The first is [Generator Return Expressions](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/generator-return-expressions), which allows you to now return a value upon (successful) completion of a generator.

Prior to PHP 7, if you tried to return anything, this would result in an error. However, now you can call `$generator->getReturn()` to retrieve the return value.

If the generator has not yet returned, or has thrown an uncaught exception, calling `$generator->getReturn()` will throw an exception.

If the generator has completed but there was no return, null is returned.

Hereâ€™s an example:

```php
function gen() {
    yield "Hello";
    yield " ";
    yield "World!";

    return "Goodbye Moon!";
}

$gen = gen();

foreach ($gen as $value) {
    echo $value; 
}

// Outputs "Hello" on iteration 1, " " on iterator 2, and "World!" on iteration 3

echo $gen->getReturn(); // Goodbye Moon!
```

### Generator Delegation

The second feature is much more exciting: [Generator Delegation](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/generator-delegation). This allows you to return another iterable structure that can itself be traversed â€”Â whether that is an array, an iterator, or another generator.

It is important to understand that iteration of sub-structures is done by the outer-most original loop as if it were a single flat structure, rather than a recursive one.

This is also true when sending data or exceptions into a generator. They are passed directly onto the sub-structure as if it were being controlled directly by the call.

This is done using the `yield from <expression>` syntax, like so:

```php
function hello() {
     yield "Hello";
     yield " ";
     yield "World!";

     yield from goodbye();
}

function goodbye() {
     yield "Goodbye";
     yield " ";
     yield "Moon!";
}

$gen = hello();
foreach ($gen as $value) {
     echo $value;
}
```

On each iteration, this will output:

1.  "Hello"
2.  " "
3.  "World!"
4.  "Goodbye"
5.  " "
6.  "Moon!"

One other caveat worth mentioning is that because the sub-structure can yield itâ€™s own keys, it is entirely possibly that the same key will be returned for multiple iterations â€”Â it is your responsibility to avoid that, if it matters to you.

## Engine Exceptions

Handling of fatal and catchable fatal errors has traditionally been impossible, or at least difficult, in PHP. But with the addition of [Engine Exceptions](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/engine_exceptions_for_php7), many of these errors will now throw exceptions instead.

Now, when a fatal or catchable fatal error occurs, it will throw an exception, allowing you to handle it gracefully. If you do not handle it at all, it will result in a traditional fatal error as an uncaught exception.

These exceptions are `\EngineException` objects, and unlike all userland exceptions, do not extend the base `\Exception` class. This is to ensure that existing code that catches the `\Exception` class does not start catching fatal errors moving forward. It thus maintains backwards compatibility.

In the future, if you wish to catch both traditional exceptions _and_ engine exceptions, you will need to catch their new shared parent class, `\BaseException`.

Additionally, parse errors in `eval()`â€™ed code will throw a `\ParseException`, while type mismatches will throw a `\TypeException`.

Hereâ€™s an example:

```php
try {
    nonExistentFunction();
} catch (\EngineException $e) {
     var_dump($e);
}

object(EngineException)#1 (7) {
  ["message":protected]=>
  string(32) "Call to undefined function nonExistantFunction()"
  ["string":"BaseException":private]=>
  string(0) ""
  ["code":protected]=>
  int(1)
  ["file":protected]=>
  string(17) "engine-exceptions.php"
  ["line":protected]=>
  int(1)
  ["trace":"BaseException":private]=>
  array(0) {
  }
  ["previous":"BaseException":private]=>
  NULL
}
```

## Coming Soon!

PHP 7.0.0 is only eight months away, making it quite possibly the quickest major version in PHPâ€™s history. While itâ€™s still alpha quality, PHP 7 is shaping up really nicely.

And you can help make it better.

### Test Your Code

Grab Rasmusâ€™s [PHP 7 vagrant box](http://github.com/rlerdorf/php7dev) and start running your test suites, or performing your regular QA. Report [bugs](http://bugs.php.net) to the project, and try again regularly.

### Help GoPHP7-ext

One of the major hurdles for PHP 7 is ensuring that all extensions are updated to work with the new Zend Engine 3.

If you use an extension that isnâ€™t well known, and doesnâ€™t get much love from itâ€™s maintainers â€“ or if you have your own extensions â€“ check out the [GoPHP7-ext project](http://gophp7.org/gophp7-ext/) and get involved in making sure that everything is ready to go on day one.

### Write Documentation

Every new feature in PHP 7 has an RFC. They can all be found on the [PHP.net wiki](http://wiki.php.net/rfc) and are a good starting point for writing new documentation. You can do that [online in a GUI environment](https://edit.php.net), including commiting (if you have karma) or by submitting patches for review.

## In Summary

PHP 7 is going to be _great_!

Go test your applications. Help migrate extensions.
